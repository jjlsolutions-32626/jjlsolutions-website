      "mainEntity": [
        {"@type": "Question", "name": "Why is my computer so slow?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "The most common causes are too many programs launching at startup, a nearly full hard drive, or not enough RAM. Press Ctrl + Shift + Esc to open Task Manager and check the Startup tab — disable anything you don't need running automatically. If your C: drive is more than 85% full, run Disk Cleanup and move large files to an external drive. If those steps don't help, upgrading from a traditional hard drive to an SSD is the single biggest performance improvement you can make — often cheaper than buying new."}},
        {"@type": "Question", "name": "How much RAM do I actually need?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "For basic use — web browsing, email, and documents — 8GB is the comfortable minimum. If you multitask heavily or run specialized software, 16GB is the sweet spot. Press Ctrl + Shift + Esc, click the Performance tab, and look at Memory. If you're consistently using 80% or more, an upgrade will make a noticeable difference."}},
        {"@type": "Question", "name": "Should I repair my old computer or buy a new one?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "If the computer is less than 5-6 years old and the main issue is speed, an SSD and RAM upgrade can make it feel new for a fraction of the cost. If the motherboard is failing, the screen is cracked, or it can't run the software you need, replacement usually makes more sense. We're always honest about this — we'd rather save you money with a repair than sell you on something you don't need."}},
        {"@type": "Question", "name": "Why does my WiFi keep dropping?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "Try power-cycling your modem and router first — unplug both, wait 30 seconds, plug the modem in first and let it fully connect, then plug in the router. This fixes the problem more often than people expect. If it keeps happening, common causes include an overheating router, interference from other devices, outdated firmware, or your ISP having intermittent issues. If your router is more than 3-4 years old, it may be time for a replacement."}},
        {"@type": "Question", "name": "I have dead spots in my house. What can I do?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "Dead spots happen when your router can't push signal through walls or across long distances. Florida block construction makes this especially common. The most effective fix is a mesh WiFi system — multiple access points that work together to blanket your home. Before buying anything, try moving your router to a more central location, elevated off the floor. That one free step solves the problem for a surprising number of people."}},
        {"@type": "Question", "name": "What internet options are available in Levy County?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "It varies by location. In town you'll generally have cable or DSL. Outside of town, satellite (Starlink, HughesNet, Viasat) and fixed wireless are the main options. Starlink has been a game-changer for rural homes, though it has a higher upfront equipment cost. We can help you figure out what's available at your address and which option fits your needs and budget."}},
        {"@type": "Question", "name": "I got a pop-up saying my computer is infected. Is it real?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "Almost certainly not. These are fake warning pages designed to scare you into calling a phone number where scammers will charge you for \"repairs\" or get remote access to your computer. Close it by pressing Ctrl + W or Alt + F4. If it won't close, use Ctrl + Alt + Delete to open Task Manager and end the browser process. Your computer is fine — it was just a webpage."}},
        {"@type": "Question", "name": "How do I know if an email is a phishing scam?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "Check the sender's actual email address — not just the display name. Watch for urgent language, generic greetings, spelling mistakes, and links that don't match the company's real website. The safest rule: never click links in emails asking you to verify your account or payment information. Go directly to the company's website by typing the address yourself."}},
        {"@type": "Question", "name": "Do I need antivirus software?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "Windows 10 and 11 come with Windows Defender built in, and it's genuinely good. For most home users, it's all you need as long as you keep Windows updated. You don't need to pay for Norton or McAfee. We recommend running a free scan with Malwarebytes occasionally as a second opinion."}},
        {"@type": "Question", "name": "Someone called saying they're from Microsoft. Is it real?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "No. Hang up. Microsoft does not make unsolicited phone calls about computer problems. Neither does Apple, your internet provider, or the IRS. Never give remote access to your computer to someone who calls you out of the blue. If you've already let someone access your machine, change your passwords from a different device and run a full antivirus scan."}},
        {"@type": "Question", "name": "How should I back up my files?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "An external hard drive paired with a cloud backup. Use Windows File History or Mac Time Machine to automatically back up to the external drive. Then add a cloud service like Backblaze ($7/month per computer) for offsite protection. The key is automation. If the backup depends on you remembering to do it, it won't happen consistently."}},
        {"@type": "Question", "name": "My computer won't turn on. Is my data gone?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "Not necessarily. A computer that won't power on is usually a power supply, motherboard, or battery issue — the hard drive where your files live is often perfectly fine. We can remove the drive and recover your data in most cases. If the drive itself has failed, recovery is still possible but may require specialized tools. Don't keep trying to turn it on — that can make things worse."}},
        {"@type": "Question", "name": "My printer won't print. What should I try?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "Make sure it's powered on and connected, check that it's set as the default printer, and clear the print queue. Go to Settings > Printers & Scanners, find your printer, and click \"Open print queue.\" Cancel any stuck jobs and try again. If it's a WiFi printer, it may have lost its connection after a router restart. You'll need to reconnect it through the printer's settings menu."}},
        {"@type": "Question", "name": "What kind of printer should I buy?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "For occasional home use, a basic laser printer is the best value — they're more reliable than inkjets, the toner doesn't dry out, and cost per page is lower. Brother and HP make solid options in the $100-$150 range. If you need color or photo printing, an inkjet makes sense — just avoid models with proprietary ink systems that block third-party cartridges."}},
        {"@type": "Question", "name": "Do I need a server for my small business?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "If you have fewer than five employees and mainly need to share files, a cloud solution like Microsoft 365 or Google Workspace combined with a NAS device is usually simpler and cheaper. If you need centralized user management or have compliance requirements, a small server starts making sense. We help small offices around Levy County figure out which approach actually fits — without overselling hardware you don't need."}},
        {"@type": "Question", "name": "How do I set up a business network?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "At minimum: a business-grade router, a proper WiFi access point, and wired Ethernet connections for stationary devices. For larger offices, add a managed switch, separate guest WiFi, and a basic firewall configuration. We handle network design and installation for businesses throughout the area, including Cat6 cable runs and VLAN configuration."}}

<p>If it's a WiFi printer, it may have lost its connection after a router restart. You'll need to reconnect it through the printer's settings menu.</p>

                    <p>For occasional home use, a basic <strong>laser printer</strong> is the best value — they're more reliable than inkjets, the toner doesn't dry out, and cost per page is lower. Brother and HP make solid options in the $100-$150 range.</p>
<p>If you need color or photo printing, an inkjet makes sense — just avoid models with proprietary ink systems that block third-party cartridges.</p>

                    <p>If you have fewer than five employees and mainly need to share files, a cloud solution like Microsoft 365 or Google Workspace combined with a NAS device is usually simpler and cheaper. If you need centralized user management or have compliance requirements, a small server starts making sense.</p>
<p>We help small offices around Levy County figure out which approach actually fits — without overselling hardware you don't need.</p>
