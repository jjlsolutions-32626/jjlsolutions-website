                <p>When the internet feels slow, the natural reaction is to blame your provider. But about half the time, the connection itself is fine — it's your home WiFi that's the bottleneck.</p>

<h2>The Simple Test</h2>
<p>Connect a computer directly to your modem or router with an Ethernet cable. Run a speed test at <strong>speedtest.net</strong> and write down the results. Then disconnect the cable, connect to WiFi from the same spot, and test again.</p>
<p>If wired speed is close to what you're paying for but WiFi is significantly slower, <strong>your internet is fine — the issue is your WiFi setup.</strong> If both are slow, <strong>the issue is your connection</strong> and it's time to call your provider.</p>

<h2>Common WiFi Fixes</h2>
<p>Router placement (move it central and elevated), an old router that doesn't support modern speeds, too many devices competing for bandwidth, or interference from neighboring networks. Switching from 2.4GHz to 5GHz gives faster speeds at shorter range.</p>

<h2>Common Provider Issues</h2>
<p>Check if you're on an outdated plan — many people are paying for 25 Mbps when faster plans are available at the same price. Call your provider and ask; they may upgrade you just for asking.</p>
