                <h1>Why Is My Computer Running So Slow?</h1>
                <p class="article-subtitle">It's the most common complaint we hear, and it usually has a pretty simple explanation.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="article-body">
                <p>If your computer takes forever to start up, programs freeze when you try to open them, or everything just feels sluggish, you're not alone. It's probably the number one issue people call us about here in Chiefland and around Levy County. The good news is that a slow computer doesn't always mean you need a new one.</p>

<h2>Too Many Programs Starting Up Automatically</h2>
<p>This is the single biggest culprit we see. Over time, programs add themselves to your startup list. Each one takes memory and processing power, and after a while, your computer is trying to launch a dozen things the moment you turn it on.</p>
<p>To check this on Windows 10 or 11, press <strong>Ctrl + Shift + Esc</strong> to open Task Manager, then click the <strong>Startup</strong> tab. If you see programs you don't use regularly, right-click them and select <strong>Disable</strong>. This doesn't uninstall anything — it just stops them from loading automatically.</p>

<h2>Your Hard Drive Is Almost Full</h2>
<p>When your main drive gets close to capacity, Windows slows down significantly. It needs free space to manage temporary files and updates. If you're under 10-15% free space, you'll notice things getting sluggish.</p>
<p>Open File Explorer and look at your C: drive. If the bar is red, that's your sign. Start by emptying the Recycle Bin, running Disk Cleanup, and moving large files to an external drive.</p>

<h2>You Might Need More RAM</h2>
<p>RAM is your computer's short-term memory — it's what lets you have a browser open with several tabs, plus Word, plus email. A lot of older computers came with 4GB, which struggles with modern software. Upgrading to 8GB or 16GB is usually one of the most cost-effective improvements you can make.</p>

<h2>An Old Hard Drive vs. an SSD</h2>
<p>If your computer still has a traditional spinning hard drive, swapping to a solid-state drive is honestly the single biggest upgrade we recommend. Boot times go from minutes to seconds, programs open almost instantly, and everything just responds faster.</p>
<p>We do this upgrade regularly for folks around here, and the reaction is always the same — it feels like a brand new computer. Often cheaper than buying new, too.</p>

<div class="callout-box">
<strong>Quick Check Before You Call</strong>
Try these three things first: restart your computer (a real restart, not just closing the lid), disable unnecessary startup programs, and run Disk Cleanup. If it's still slow after that, there may be a deeper issue worth looking at.
</div>

<h2>When It's Something More Serious</h2>
<p>Sometimes a slow computer points to malware running in the background, a failing hard drive, overheating, or outdated drivers. If you've tried the steps above and things aren't improving, that's when it makes sense to have someone take a closer look.</p>
