                <p class="article-subtitle">The real problem isn't weak passwords — it's reusing them everywhere.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="article-body">
                <p>You already know you shouldn't use "password123" for everything. But managing dozens of unique, complex passwords feels impossible. Here's how to actually handle it.</p>

<h2>The Real Problem</h2>
<p>The biggest risk isn't having a weak password on one account — it's using the same password everywhere. When a company gets hacked, attackers try those leaked passwords on banking sites, email, and social media. If you reuse passwords, one breach compromises everything.</p>

<h2>The Practical Solution: A Password Manager</h2>
<p>A password manager generates and stores unique passwords for every account. You only remember one master password. <strong>Bitwarden</strong> is free, open-source, and works on every platform. <strong>1Password</strong> is excellent if you're willing to pay a few dollars monthly.</p>

<h2>If You Won't Use a Manager</h2>
<p>Use the passphrase method: pick four or five random, unrelated words. Something like "correct horse battery staple" is far stronger than "P@ssw0rd!" because length beats complexity.</p>

<h2>Turn On Two-Factor Authentication</h2>
<p>Enable 2FA on every account that offers it — especially email and banking. Even if someone gets your password, they can't log in without a code from your phone. It takes 30 seconds to set up and is the single best thing you can do for account security.</p>
