            <div class="article-body">
                <p>You press the power button and nothing happens. Or maybe you get a brief flash of lights and then it goes dead. Before you assume the worst, there are a few things worth checking.</p>

<h2>Start With the Obvious</h2>
<p>Check your power connections. Make sure the power cable is firmly plugged into both the computer and the wall outlet. Try a different outlet. If you're using a power strip, plug directly into the wall to rule that out. We've made house calls where the fix was literally a loose cable.</p>
<p>For laptops, try removing the charger, holding the power button down for 15 seconds, then plugging the charger back in and pressing power normally. This drains residual charge and resets the power circuit.</p>

<h2>What the Lights and Sounds Tell You</h2>
<p>If <strong>absolutely nothing happens</strong> — no lights, no fan spin — the issue is almost always power-related. Dead power supply on a desktop, dead battery or charging circuit on a laptop.</p>
<p>If you get <strong>lights and fan spin but no display</strong>, that points to RAM, graphics, or motherboard issues. Try connecting to a different monitor or TV with an HDMI cable.</p>
<p>If it <strong>starts to boot then shuts off</strong>, overheating is common. Dust buildup inside the case blocks airflow. This is especially common in Florida — humidity and pet hair are a bad combination.</p>

<h2>The Good News About Your Data</h2>
<p>A computer that won't turn on doesn't mean your files are gone. The hard drive is a separate component from the parts that are likely failing. In most cases, we can pull the drive and recover everything.</p>
