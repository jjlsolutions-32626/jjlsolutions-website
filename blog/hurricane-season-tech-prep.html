            </div>

            <div class="article-body">
                <p>Living in North Central Florida means hurricane season is part of the calendar. Most people stock up on water and flashlights, but we've seen too many people lose irreplaceable files and expensive equipment because their technology didn't get the same preparation.</p>

<h2>Back Up Everything</h2>
<p>Before hurricane season starts, make sure you have a current backup. At minimum, copy important files to an external hard drive you can grab if you evacuate. Better yet, have a cloud backup running so your data is safe regardless of what happens to the hardware.</p>

<h2>Surge Protection Is Not Optional</h2>
<p>A basic power strip is not a surge protector — check the packaging. Look for at least 1,000 joules. An uninterruptible power supply (UPS) gives you surge protection plus battery backup to save your work during outages.</p>

<h2>The 72-Hour Rule</h2>
<p>After a storm, power surges and fluctuations are common as the grid stabilizes. If you can, wait a bit before powering up electronics. When you do, go through the UPS or surge protector first.</p>

<div class="callout-box">
<strong>Grab-and-Go Checklist</strong>
If evacuating: external backup drive, laptop, phone chargers and power bank, critical paperwork or login information. Put these in a waterproof bag.
</div>

<h2>After the Storm</h2>
<p>Check for water damage before plugging anything in. If equipment got wet, don't power it on — let it dry for at least 48 hours. Power-cycle your modem and router if internet is back but WiFi isn't working.</p>
