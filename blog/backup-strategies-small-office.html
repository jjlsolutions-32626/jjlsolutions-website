                <h1>Simple Backup Strategies for Small Offices</h1>
                <p class="article-subtitle">Your business data is worth more than the hardware it lives on.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="article-body">
                <p>We work with small businesses and law offices around Levy County, and one of the first things we ask is: "If this computer died right now, what would you lose?" The answer is usually an uncomfortable pause.</p>

<h2>The 3-2-1 Rule</h2>
<p>Three copies of your data, on two different types of storage, with one copy offsite. For a small office: files on your computer (copy one), an external drive or NAS backing up automatically each night (copy two), and a cloud backup service (copy three, offsite).</p>

<h2>External Drive Backups</h2>
<p>A 2TB external drive runs about $60-$80. Windows File History or Mac Time Machine can back up automatically. The key is automation — if it depends on someone remembering, it won't happen consistently.</p>

<h2>Cloud Backup for Offsite Protection</h2>
<p>An external drive doesn't protect against floods or fire. Backblaze runs about $7/month per computer for unlimited backup, runs in the background, and you can restore from anywhere.</p>

<div class="callout-box">
<strong>The Real Test</strong>
A backup plan is only as good as your ability to restore from it. Pick a random file and confirm you can get it back. If you've never tested your restore process, you don't really have a backup.
</div>

<h2>NAS Devices for Larger Offices</h2>
<p>If you have more than two or three computers, a network-attached storage device backs up all your machines automatically and serves as a file sharing hub. Synology and QNAP are popular and reliable.</p>
