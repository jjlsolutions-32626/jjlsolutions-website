                <p class="article-subtitle">If something feels off, trust your gut. Here's what to watch for.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="article-body">
                <p>We get calls about this almost every week. Someone's browsing and suddenly their screen fills with a loud, alarming message. Or they get an official-looking email from their "bank." Or someone claiming to be from Microsoft calls about a compromised computer. These are all scams.</p>

<h2>The Scary Pop-Up</h2>
<p>Full-screen warnings with flashing text and phone numbers are just webpages designed to panic you. Real security software doesn't do this. Close it with <strong>Ctrl + W</strong> or <strong>Alt + F4</strong>. If it won't close, use <strong>Ctrl + Alt + Delete</strong> to end the browser process.</p>

<h2>Phishing Emails</h2>
<p>Fake messages designed to look like they're from companies you trust. They create urgency: "Account suspended," "Unusual login detected." Check the sender's actual email address. <strong>Never click links in emails asking you to verify your account.</strong> Go to the website directly.</p>

<h2>Phone Scams</h2>
<p>Microsoft, Apple, your ISP, and the IRS do not cold-call about computer problems. Hang up. Never give remote access to your computer to an unsolicited caller.</p>

<div class="callout-box">
<strong>Already Fell for One?</strong>
Change your important passwords from a different device, run a full antivirus scan, and check your bank statements. If you gave out financial information, contact your bank immediately.
</div>

<h2>When Something Feels Wrong</h2>
<p>The best defense is to slow down. Scams work by creating urgency and panic. If a message or call is pressuring you to act immediately, that itself is a red flag.</p>
