                <p class="article-subtitle">Small businesses get targeted more often than you'd think. Here's how to be ready.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="article-body">
                <p>Ransomware encrypts your files — documents, photos, databases, everything — and demands payment to unlock them. Small businesses are actually hit more frequently than large ones because they tend to have weaker defenses.</p>

<h2>How It Gets In</h2>
<p>The most common entry point is email. Someone opens an attachment or clicks a link in a convincing message. Within minutes, the ransomware spreads across the network, encrypting everything it can reach — including shared drives and connected backup devices.</p>

<h2>How to Protect Yourself</h2>
<p><strong>Backups are the most important piece.</strong> If you have a recent, clean backup stored offline or in a cloud service that wasn't connected during the attack, you can wipe the infected systems and restore everything. This is why the 3-2-1 backup rule matters so much.</p>
<p>Beyond backups: keep all software updated, train your team to recognize phishing emails, use business-grade antivirus, and restrict user permissions so not everyone has admin access.</p>

<h2>Have a Plan Before You Need One</h2>
<p>Having tested backups, updated systems, and a basic incident response plan makes the difference between a bad day and a business-ending event.</p>
