                <h1>How to Set Up a Guest WiFi Network</h1>
                <p class="article-subtitle">A simple step that adds real security to your home or business network.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="article-body">
                <p>When someone visits and asks for the WiFi password, you're giving them access to the same network as your personal computer, smart TV, security cameras, and everything else. A guest network is a separate WiFi connection that shares your internet but is isolated from your devices.</p>

<h2>How to Set One Up</h2>
<p>Most routers made in the last five years have a guest network option built in. Log into your router's admin page (usually 192.168.1.1 or 192.168.0.1), look for "Guest Network," and enable it. Give it a different name and set a simple password.</p>

<h2>A Smart Move for Smart Homes</h2>
<p>Consider putting your IoT devices (smart plugs, cameras, voice assistants) on the guest network and keeping your computers on the main one. Many smart home devices have weaker security, and if one gets compromised, network isolation keeps the damage contained.</p>

<h2>For Small Businesses</h2>
<p>If you have a storefront or office where customers come in, a guest network is basically required. You want to provide WiFi as a courtesy without exposing your business systems. We set these up for businesses around Levy County, including bandwidth limits so guest usage doesn't slow down your work.</p>
