            </div>

            <div class="article-body">
                <p>If you've got WiFi dead spots, you've probably looked at two solutions: range extenders and mesh systems. They both promise to fix the problem, but they work very differently.</p>

<h2>How Extenders Work (and Why They Disappoint)</h2>
<p>A WiFi extender picks up your existing signal and rebroadcasts it. The catch: it cuts your speed roughly in half because it uses the same radio to receive and retransmit. You'll get signal in the dead spot, but streaming and video calls may still struggle.</p>
<p>Extenders also create a separate network (usually with "_EXT" at the end), so your devices don't automatically switch as you move around.</p>

<h2>How Mesh Systems Work</h2>
<p>A mesh system uses two or more access points that all share one network name. Your devices connect to whichever point is strongest and hand off seamlessly as you move room to room. No speed penalty because the units communicate on a dedicated channel.</p>
<p>TP-Link Deco, Google Nest WiFi, and Eero are all solid picks. For a typical Levy County home in the 1,500-2,500 square foot range, a three-pack handles it well.</p>

<h2>The Best Setup: Mesh With Wired Backhaul</h2>
<p>Running Ethernet cable between your mesh points eliminates wireless overhead entirely. This is especially worthwhile if you work from home or have a house full of devices.</p>
<p>We run Cat6 wiring for homes around the area and can set up a mesh system that covers everything from the front door to the back shop.</p>
